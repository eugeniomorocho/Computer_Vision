# Computer Vision Notebooks

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Computer Vision course. This repository is designed to provide you with hands-on experience and in-depth understanding of fundamental AI topics. The notebooks include both coding exercises and project-based activities, and were created using Python 3 as the interpreter.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/eugeniomorocho/Computer_Vision.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific Notebook's directory:  

   ```
   cd Computer_Vision/NOTEBOOK_x/
   ```
   
3. Follow the instructions in the file for each week's lab.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x as the interpreter
- Additional dependencies specified in each week's lab instructions
